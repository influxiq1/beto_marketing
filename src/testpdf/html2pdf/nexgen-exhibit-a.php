NGT’s requisition forms will emphasize physician choice and encourage physicians to order, to the extent possible, only those tests that they believe are appropriate for each patient. When NGT creates a custom profile for a physician, the requesting physician will be required to sign an acknowledgement that the physician has requested the custom profile; has been provided Medicare reimbursement amount for each test; has been told to order medically necessary tests only; understands that some tests may not be reimbursed; and has the right to not use the custom profile and order tests differently for any patient.

In addition, when an officer, director, employee or affiliate is faced with a potential conflict of interest, he or she should seek guidance from the Chief Compliance Officer before proceeding. Whenever an officer, director, employee or affiliate has a question about whether a situation presents a conflict, he or she should contact the Chief Compliance Officer.
